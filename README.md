# Sports Events Portal 

## Developed by Rishita Choubey

### A Web Application for Sports Day Event Registration

---

### Project Overview

This ReactJS-based web application offers a platform for discovering and registering for sports day events. It features dynamic data rendering from mock APIs, user interaction for event selection, and UI responsiveness.

### Key Functionalities

- **Event Browsing**: Display events in a dynamic card layout with details like name, category, and time.
- **Event Selection**: Implement logic for user selections with constraints (up to 3 events, no timing conflicts).
- **Data Persistence**: Ensure selections remain after page reloads, using browser storage solutions.

### Technical Details

- **ReactJS**: Utilizes component-based architecture for modular development and efficient state management.
- **Mock API Integration**: Fetches event data dynamically to simulate real-world application scenarios.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Incorporates logic to prevent users from selecting overlapping events.

### Development Highlights

- **Component-Driven Development**: Emphasizes reusable UI components for scalability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: Uses React's Context API and Reducers for global state handling and to manage user selections.
- **Responsive Design**: Adheres to responsive design principles for optimal user experience across devices.
